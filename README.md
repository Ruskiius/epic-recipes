# Odin-recipes
This is my first project I'm working on during my journey with The Odin Project. 

It is called "Baking Bad Recipes". Recipes in the Breaking Bad/BCS universe written in-character.

Also yes I know none of the recipes involve baking. The name just sounded epic.

Baking Bad Recipes is going to consist of a main index page which will link to a couple recipes.
I will be only using HTML for now but in the future I will style it up with CSS.


I hope you enjoy (also try not to die reading it)
