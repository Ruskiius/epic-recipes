    <h2>What is fried chicken, you may ask?</h2>

    <p style="margin: 20px;">Ah, fried chicken. A dish that requires a certain finesse, a certain attention to detail, much like the operation of a successful business. The process is simple, yet effective. The chicken, it is coated in a blend of select spices and flour, a recipe closely guarded like the recipe for our famous Los Pollos Hermanos' special seasoning.
