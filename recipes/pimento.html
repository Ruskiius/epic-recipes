    <h2> What is it?</h2>

    <p>Pimento Cheese, huh? Well, it's a type of cheese spread made from cheddar cheese mixed with mayo, cream cheese, pimentos, garlic powder and black pepper. 
        It's a Southern delicacy, usually served as a dip or sandwich spread. It's nothing fancy, but it's comforting and gets the job done.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Alright, first things first. You're gonna need some good quality cheddar cheese (you can also mix in some white cheddar or extra-sharp cheddar for some additional <strong><a href="https://i.imgur.com/l5A46Kd.jpeg">zest</a></strong>), <strong><em>none of that pre-shredded nonsense.</em></strong> 
        You'll also need some mayo, cream cheese, pimentos, garlic powder and a bit of black pepper. 
        Now, you'll want to shred your cheddar cheese, mix it with the mayo and cream cheese, add in your pimentos, garlic powder, and black pepper. 
        Make sure to mix it all together real good. And that's it, you got yourself a batch of Pimento Cheese dip.</p>


        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p> Alright so, lets get to it. No time to waste:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese <strong>NO PRE SHREDDED BS!!</strong></li>
            <li>8 ounces of creem cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of mayonnaise</li>
            <li>Jalapeno pepper (now, this is optional unless you need extra <strong>zest</strong>)</li>
            <li>4 ounce jar of diced pimento, drained</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon of onion powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
            <p>I suggest adding additional seasoning for additional zestiness, if you so desire.</p>

        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>Pretty dang simple. Even <a href="https://carboncostume.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/hectortiosalamanca5.jpg">hector</a> can do it.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>In a medium mixing bowl, combine the grated cheese and cream cheese.</li>
            <li></li>
        </ol>
