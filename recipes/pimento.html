    <h2> What is it?</h2>

    <p>Pimento Cheese, huh? Well, it's a type of cheese spread made from cheddar cheese mixed with mayo, cream cheese, pimentos, garlic powder and black pepper. 
        It's a Southern delicacy, usually served as a dip or sandwich spread. It's nothing fancy, but it's comforting and gets the job done.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Alright, first things first. You're gonna need some good quality cheddar cheese, <strong>none of that pre-shredded nonsense.</strong> 
        You'll also need some mayo, cream cheese, pimentos, garlic powder and a bit of black pepper. 
        Now, you'll want to shred your cheddar cheese, mix it with the mayo and cream cheese, add in your pimentos, garlic powder, and black pepper. 
        Make sure to mix it all together real good. And that's it, you got yourself a batch of Pimento Cheese dip.</p>
