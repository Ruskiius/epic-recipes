    <p style="margin: 20px;">Carne Asada Tacos, you ever heard of them? Of course you have, 
        everyone knows what they are. But let me tell you, not all 
        Carne Asada Tacos are created equal. 
        You gotta know how to make them right.</p>

        <p style="margin:20px;">Carne Asada Tacos are made with grilled or 
            pan-fried steak, usually skirt or flank steak, which is then thinly sliced 
            and placed in a warm corn tortilla, 
            sometimes with diced onions and cilantro. 
            The marinade for the steak can vary, but typically includes lime juice, garlic, and chili powder for a little kick.

        <p style="margin:20px;"> But let me tell you, it's not just about the 
                steak, 
                it's about the whole experience. 
                You gotta have the right tortillas, 
                the right toppings, and the right attitude. 
                That's when you'll truly experience the best 
                Carne Asada Tacos.</p>

                    <li>4 cloves of minced garlic</li>
                    <li>2 tsp of cumin</li>
                    <li>1 tsp of chili powder (add extra for more <strong>zest</strong></li>)

                <ol>
                    <li> In a large resealable bag or a shallow dish, mix together the orange juice, lime juice, olive oil, garlic, cumin, oregano, chili powder, salt and pepper.

                    <li> 
                        Add the steak to the marinade and toss to coat. Marinate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight in the refrigerator. Lalo personally recommends overnight for maximum <strong>zest</strong>. 

                    </li>

                    <li>Preheat grill to high heat</li>

                    <li> Remove the steak from the marinade, shaking off any excess.</li>
                    
                    <li>Grill the steak for 3-4 minutes per side for medium-rare or until desired doneness.</li>
                    
                    <li>Remove from grill and let it rest for 5-10 minutes for slicing</li>

                    <li>Heat the tortillas on the grill or in a dry skillet until it's warm and pliable.</li>

                    <li>Serve the steak with some warm tortillas, toppings of your desire and enjoy amigo!</li>
                
                </ol>
